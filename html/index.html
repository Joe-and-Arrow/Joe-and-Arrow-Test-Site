            <ol>
                <li>Joe and Arrow is a play on bow and arrow, because I LOVE ranged weapons that are not straight shots, it makes them harder to master, but much more satisfying. I made the name because I love using a bow in Minecraft!</li>
                <li>I started playing Minecraft in beta 1.8 and I have played it ever since.</li>
                <li>I started a gaming YouTube channel in preparation for the game Hytale, which is in development by Hypixel Studios, the creators of the most popular Minecraft server Hypixel.net</li>
                <li>My biggest aspiration is to play in Minecraft Championships with the chill YouTuber's who play on that server.</li>
                <li>I went to college for Musical Theatre.</li>
