            <p>I'm Joe and Arrow. I'm passionate about a ton of different things, I enjoy playing video games, and creating good memories with good people.</p>
            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p>One of the most exciting parts of life for me is learning new things. I am constantly looking at new subjects to learn for fun! Game development, YouTube, web development, piano, cooking, singing, guitar, Blender, art, pixel art, getting good at gaming- just to name a few.</p>
            <h2>Creating</h2>
            <p>I am learning to create content, whether that be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JoeAndArrow/videos" target="_blank" title="Subscribe to Joe and Arrow's YouTube Channel">YouTube</a>, music, games, or other creative works; I'm ready to win or learn.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Joe and Arrow is a play on bow and arrow, because I LOVE ranged weapons that are not straight shots, it makes them harder to master, but much more satisfying. I made the name because I love using a bow in Minecraft!</li>
                <li>I started playing Minecraft in beta 1.8 and I have played it ever since.</li>
                <li>I started a gaming YouTube channel in preparation for the game <a href="https://youtu.be/ftOmBG5NrbA" target="_blank" title="Hytale: The Rise and Fall of Hype">Hytale </a>, which is in development by Hypixel Studios, the creators of the most popular Minecraft server Hypixel.net</li>
                <li>My biggest aspiration is to play in Minecraft Championships with the chill YouTuber's who play on that server.</li>
                <li>I went to college for Musical Theatre.</li>
